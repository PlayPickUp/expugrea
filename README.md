#### 📍 Expugrea is a starting point for Express, Pug, and React.

Expugrea is similar to Create React App, where you can easily get a project up and running without the trouble of configuring the same things over and over again.

---

## 💾 Installation

You don't need to install Expugrea to your machine to get started. Simply run the following command:

```sh
npx expugrea your-project-name
```

It will then take care of setting up Express, Pug, and React for you.
