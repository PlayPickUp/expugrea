**_🏈 Kickoff is a (pretty) un-opinionated starting point for Node/Express/React projects_**. It is similar to projects like Create React App, where you can easily get a project up and running without the trouble of configuring the same tools over and over again. It lets you focus on the work that matters.

## 🤔 Why should I use Kickoff?

- Uses **Typescript**, comes configured and ready to go
- **Webpack** configured and ready - don't worry, we got ya
- **Prettier** configurations to optimize code styling
- JavaScript linting with **ESLint**
- Pre-commit/push hooks with **Husky**
- **Express** server with common configurations
- It's friggin easy

## 🦸🏽‍♀️ Getting Started

No installation neccesary. Just run the following command and we take care of the rest.

```sh
npx @playpickup/kickoff your-project-name
```
